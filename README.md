# Shielded_Guide
Shielded Guide is a Python library designed to provide robust security and privacy tools for applications. It includes functionalities for encryption, authentication, access control, logging, and secure data handling. The library ensures that developers can easily integrate security best practices into their applications without complex implementations.

1.Cipher: This class encrypts data using AES-based encryption and allows secure decryption when needed.

2.AuthManager: This class hashes passwords, verifies logins, and generates authentication tokens for secure access.

3.AccessControl: This class assigns roles to users and checks permissions before granting access.

4.SecureLogger: This class records failed login attempts, access violations, and suspicious activity.

5.Datasanitizer: This class sanitizes user input before storing it in a database or displaying it on a webpage.
